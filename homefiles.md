Edit your .bashrc file with:
Two useful aliases
"awesome" bash aliases
30 okay aliases
70 more aliases

- I ended up just going with editing the ~/bashrc file and added my aliases from there.

Something cool from The Ultimate B.A. .bashrc file
Verify your added aliases / bash additions work - install additional packages if required
Copy your .bashrc file to your dotfiles repository in homefiles
Write a script that:
Optional, pick one:

symbolically links the .bashrc file in your dotfiles repository to the user's home directory
reminds the user to reload their environment (with source or by logging out and back on)


A recovery .bashrc file is here if it is needed. While testing, I named a new file new_bashrc and tried loading it into the shell (source new_bashrc) to check for errors.

I was curious and asked Co-pilot to list the aliases so I could copy and paste them into the .baschrc file. (It is pretty neat being able to shorten commands to make it easier to complete tasks. I did go through the 100+ different aliases given just to make sure nothing was a copy or would mess with each other. I only ended up adding a handful out of the ones I seen.)

I did have to ask Co-pilot for help getting the source new_bashrc to check for errors. When I tried to use the command (source ~/new_bashrc) it told me the file never existed. I asked co-pilot what needed to  be done to achieve this in ubuntu and it told me that I also have to make the new baschrc file and copy that to the homefiles as well.

The last thing I did as I don't know all the commands i did ask co pilot how to copy files and it helped by spitting out the code to do so.
