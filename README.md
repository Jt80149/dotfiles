# dotfiles task 2 / homefiles

I was curious and asked Co-pilot to list the aliases so I could copy and paste them into the .baschrc file. (It is pretty neat being able to shorten commands to make it easier to complete tasks. I did go through the 100+ different aliases given just to make sure nothing was a copy or would mess with each other. I only ended up adding a handful out of the ones I seen.)

I did have to ask Co-pilot for help getting the source new_bashrc to check for errors. When I tried to use the command (source ~/new_bashrc) it told me the file never existed. I asked co-pilot what needed to  be done to achieve this in ubuntu and it told me that I also have to make the new baschrc file and copy that to the homefiles as well.

The last thing I did as I don't know all the commands i did ask co pilot how to copy files and it helped by spitting out the code to do so.
