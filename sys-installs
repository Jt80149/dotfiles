Steps Followed:
Create the sys-installs folder:
mkdir -p ~/path/to/your/dotfiles/sys-installs


Save the script above to a file named install-aws-cli.sh in the sys-installs folder:
nano ~/path/to/your/dotfiles/sys-installs/install-aws-cli.sh


Make the script executable:
chmod +x ~/path/to/your/dotfiles/sys-installs/install-aws-cli.sh


Works Cited:
"where do i go to add the script"   (because i wasnt logged into the ubuntu sever. I was still in powershell.)

"cd dotfiles/sys-installs is the path. How do i execute?" (Same thing)



"what would a script from AWS Command Line Interface (CLI) look like?"
"give me another one"
